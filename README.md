# Tkinter-Spaceship
A game where the player can either choose to enter a planet code or start off from Earth. It the player chooses a planet code, they get taken to the planet that corresponds to the planet code. The player has to figure out the velocity to go to a different planet. If they fail to properly figure out the velocity, then they crash and the game starts over. As the player goes from one planet to another, they accumulate points which is stored in a High scores file displayed upon the players death. Tkinter version of the non-GUI version.
